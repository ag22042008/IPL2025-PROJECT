IPL 2025 Match & Bowling Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on IPL 2025 match and bowling data to uncover insights related to team strategies, bowling efficiency, workload management, and match impact. The analysis combines match-level trends with player-level bowling performance to reflect real-world cricket decision-making.

🔍 Key Focus Areas

Comparison of team batting performance while chasing vs defending.

Impact of toss decisions and innings order on match outcomes.

Identification of most economical bowlers using minimum overs filters.

Analysis of the relationship between economy rate, wickets, and overs bowled.

Evaluation of whether high wicket takers are also match-winning bowlers using 4W and 5W hauls.

Team-wise comparison of bowling reliability and efficiency.

📊 Techniques Used

Bar charts and box plots for match and innings analysis.

Scatter plots (with jitter) to study relationships between bowling metrics.

Team-based visual comparisons to highlight strategic patterns.

Interactive visualizations using Plotly for clearer insights.

🧠 Key Insights

Teams generally trust bowlers who maintain efficiency with higher workloads.

Wicket-taking ability does not necessarily come at the cost of economy.

Match-winning bowling performances are distinct from consistent wicket accumulation.

Chasing and defending show different scoring and winning patterns across venues and teams.
